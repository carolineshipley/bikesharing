## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to use data from New York City's Citi Bike program and analyze the feasibility to recreate the program in De Moines, Iowa.
In this analysis Python and Pandas library was used to clean up the data and to created visualizations Tableau was used. 

## Results

Throughout this analysis the following questions were answered:

1. What are the Top Stating and Ending Locations?
2. What's the duration of the majority of the rides?
3. Who is using the bikes?
4. When are users using the bikes?
5. What's the majority of the user type?

To answer these questions, the following visualizations were created:

### What are the Top Stating and Ending Locations?

## Summary

Based on the analysis, these are the top takeaways to create a successful citi bike program in De Moines:

1. Bikes should be available in the most populous area of the city
2. Advertising should target Male users as they are the main subscribers
3. Offers for weekdays traditional commuting hours should be prioritized
